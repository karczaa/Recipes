            <li>½ onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>½ cup shredded Colby Jack or Cheddar cheese</li>

            <li>1 tablespoon garlic powder</li>

            <li>ETC</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Steps</h5>

        <ol>
          <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
          <li>Meanwhile, combine ground beef, onion, cheese, egg, onion soup mix,
             minced garlic, garlic powder, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, parsley,
              basil, oregano, rosemary, salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Use your 
              hands to form the mixture into 4 patties.</li>
          <li>Cook patties on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center
                and the juices run clear, about 4 to 5 minutes per side. An instant-read
                thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees
                F (74 degrees C).</li>
